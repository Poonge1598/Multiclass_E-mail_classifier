# Multiclass Email Classifier

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of email classification using a stacked classifier, which involves stacking multiple supervised machine learning models on top of each other. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of detecting even those email types that are less common in the given dataset.

## Achievements

- Implemented a stacked classifier, combining multiple machine learning models.
- Achieved an overall accuracy of 68.6%.
- Successfully identified rare mail_type_6 instances, which comprised only 0.1% of the total training records.

## Key Learnings

- Acquired proficiency in building stacked models and skillfully optimizing their hyperparameters for enhanced performance.
- Gained insights into handling imbalanced datasets effectively.

By leveraging the stacked classifier and fine-tuning its parameters, this project demonstrates the potential to improve accuracy, particularly in cases where certain classes are underrepresented.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the techniques used here to enhance your own email classification tasks.
